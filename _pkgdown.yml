  - title: Creation of Input Validator Objects
    desc: >
      The **shinyvalidate** package offers an `InputValidator` R6 class for
      adding realtime input validation to Shiny apps. The Shiny app author
      can then add validation rules for each input field in their UI, using
      the `InputValidator$add_rule()` method. If an app contains multiple,
      independant forms then multiple `InputValidator` instances (with their
      own rules) can be created.
    contents:
    - InputValidator
    - input_provided

  - title: Rule Functions
    desc: >
      The **shinyvalidate** rule functions are used to perform the checking of
      input fields and they are assigned to and managed by a Validator object.
      This variety of `sv_*()` functions can be used to make comparison-type
      validations (e.g., is the input less than `10`?), verify that an email
      address has a valid construction, or check whether a value is even
      present. The `compose_rules()` gives us the opportunity to combine
      multiple `sv_*()` and even custom validation functions such that the first
      failing validation will issue the failure message.

    - sv_numeric
    - sv_integer
    - sv_between
    - sv_regex
